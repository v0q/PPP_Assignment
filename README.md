# Installation instructions:

qmake<br />
make clean<br />
make<br />
./super_stardust<br />
<br />
If the ship is moving sideways (rotated 90 degrees),<br />
Remove the #ifdef LINUX ... #endif (leave what's in <br />
DARWIN defs in the code). This was a bit of a hacky<br />
solution where on the uni machines the models and texture<br />
coordinates were rotated 90 degrees and I wasn't able to<br />
figure out what was wrong within the time limit.<br />
<br />
The places where this hacky solution is used are:<br />
Player.cpp 	- lines: 	56	 - 63<br />
Player.cpp 	- lines: 	118	 - 122<br />
World.cpp 	- lines:	 43	 - 50<br />
